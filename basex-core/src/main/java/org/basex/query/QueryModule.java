/**
 * <p>The XQuery {@code import module} statement can be used to import XQuery modules
 * as well as Java instances, which will be treated as modules. Any class with a public,
 * empty constructor can be imported as module.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a class extends the {@link QueryModule} class, it inherits the {@link #queryContext}
 * and {@link #staticContext} variables, which provide access to all properties of the
 * current query. E.g., they provide access to the current {@link QueryContext#next(Iter)
 * context value} or the {@link StaticContext#ns declared namespaces} of a query.</p>
 *
 * <p>The default properties of functions can be overwritten via annotations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Java functions can only be executed by users with {@code ADMIN} permissions.
 *       You may annotate a function with {@link Requires}({@link Permission}) to
 *       also make it accessible to users with less privileges.</li>
 *   <li>Java code is treated as "non-deterministic", as its behavior cannot
 *       be predicted by the XQuery processor. You may annotate a function as
 *       {@link Deterministic} if you know that it will have no side effects and will
 *       always yield the same result.</li>
 *   <li>Java code is treated as "context-independent". If a function accesses
 *       the specified {@link #queryContext}, it should be annotated as
 *       {@link ContextDependent}.</li>
 *   <li>Java code is treated as "focus-independent". If a function accesses
 *       the current context value, position or size, it should be annotated as
 *       {@link FocusDependent}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * If the {@link QueryResource} is implemented, its {@link QueryResource#close()} method will be
 * called after the query has been evaluated. It should always be implemented if a module opens
 * connections, resources, etc. that eventually need to be closed.
 *
