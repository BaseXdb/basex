/**
 * <p>Comparator for {@link NodeUpdate}.</p>
 *
 * <p>In general, a list of updates is applied from the highest to the lowest PRE value in
 * BaseX. The higher the actual location of an update the sooner it is applied, hence
 * the 'greater' {@link NodeUpdate} is applied first. The order further relies on
 * the definition of {@link UpdateType}.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link NodeUpdate}s are identified by their target node's PRE values (T).
 * Depending on the {@link UpdateType} of the update, a specific PRE value on the
 * table is affected (L). Hence it is not sufficient to order primitives based on T
 * (see case 2,3 below). It is also not sufficient to order them based on L (see case
 * 2,3 below).</p>
 *
 * <p>The first {@link NodeUpdate} is referred to as P1, the target node of P1 is
 * referred to as T1, the (optional) insertion sequence for P1 is S1, the actually
 * affected PRE value on disk is L1. For the second P2, T2, S2, L2.</p>
 *
 * <p>The result of the comparison depends on several things:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> The PRE values of T1 and T2.
 * Consider D the document {@code <DOC><N1/><N2/></DOC>}. If P1 is a {@link DeleteNode} on N1
 * and P2 is a {@link DeleteNode} on N2, it follows that T2 greater than T1. P2 wins the comparison
 * and is therefore executed first.</li>
 *
 * <li> Whether the order of P1, P2 must be switched to get the desired result.
 * Consider D the document {@code <DOC><N1><N2/></N1></DOC>}. If P1 is an {@link InsertInto} on
 * N1 and P2 is an {@link InsertInto} on N2, it follows that T2 greater than T1. Yet, executing P2
 * first would lead to the following problem:
 *
 * The actually affected PRE value location on disk for both updates is L1=L2=L=4. P2
 * inserts a sequence of nodes S2 at L. After this P1 inserts a sequence of nodes S1 at
 * the same location L and shifts S2 further back on disk. S1 and S2 are now ordered
 * incorrectly (S1,S2) and invalidate the document.
 *
 * Hence the correct order (S2,S1) can only be achieved if P1 is executed first and S1
 * subsequently shifted by inserting S2.
 *
 * The problem can exist if P1 and/or P2 are of the kind {@link InsertInto} or
 * {@link InsertAfter} and T1+size(T1) is equal T2+size(T2), hence T1 and T2 have the
 * same following node. The correct order is realized by executing the update first, that
 * is on the ancestor axis of the other. In this case P1 greater than P2.
 *
 * Another case similar to this is if P1 is an {@link InsertIntoAsFirst} on an element
 * T1 and P2 is i.e. a {@link ReplaceNode} on an attribute T2 of T1. To get the desired
 * order of insertion sequences (S2,S1) P1 must be executed first, hence P1 greater than P2.</li>
 *
 * <li> The {@link UpdateType} of P1, P2.
 * Consider D the document {@code <DOC><N1/></DOC>} with T=N1. P1 is an {@link InsertBefore}
 * on T and P2 is an {@link InsertIntoAsFirst} on the same target T. As they both operate
 * on the same target, both have not to be re-located because of their type (see case 2),
 * hence only differ in their {@link UpdateType}, it follows that P2 greater than P1 as nodes
 * S2 are to be inserted on the following axis of S1.
 *
 * Another case: P2 a {@link DeleteNode} on T and P1 an {@link InsertBefore} on T. As
 * L2=L1, P2, the execution sequence must be (P2,P1). for(P1,P2) S1 would be deleted by
 * P2. The correct order is also determined by the order of {@link UpdateType}. Here
 * we see that ordering updates simply by the actually affected PRE value L is not
 * sufficient.</li>
