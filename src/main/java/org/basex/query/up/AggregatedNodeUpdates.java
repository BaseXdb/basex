/**
 * This container holds all update primitives for a specific database node.
 * It is identified by its target node's pre value and data reference. For each
 * database node, which is target of an update primitive, a container like this
 * accumulates all primitives that operate on this target.
 *
 * The pre value and data reference are not stored explicitly but are stored
 * individually with each update primitive in this container.
 *
 *
 * After updates in this container have been applied, there may be adjacent
 * text nodes. Resolving this issue is divided into two steps:
 *
 *   1. Resolving internal text node adjacency:
 *      Can be done immediately after updates have been applied. The sibling
 *      axis of this containers target node is not affected. In addition updates
 *      on the descendant or following axis have already been carried out, as
 *      updates are applied database-wise from the highest to the lowest pre
 *      value.
 *   2. Resolving external text node adjacency:
 *      Cannot be done on-the-fly as nodes on the preceding axis, which could
 *      also be target nodes, may be affected by merges.
