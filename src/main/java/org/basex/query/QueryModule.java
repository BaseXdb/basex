/**
 * <p>The XQuery {@code import module} statement can be used to import XQuery modules
 * as well as Java instances, which will be treated as modules. Any class with a public,
 * empty constructor can be imported as module.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a class extends the {@link QueryModule} class, it inherits the {@link #context}
 * variable, which provides access to all properties of the current query. E.g., it
 * provides access to the current {@link QueryContext#value context item} or the
 * {@link QueryContext#sc static context} of a query. Next, the following default
 * properties of functions can be changed via annotations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Java functions can only be executed by users with {@code ADMIN} permissions.
 *       You may annotate a function with {@link Requires}({@link Permission}) to
 *       also make it accessible to users with less privileges.</li>
 *   <li>Java code is treated as "non-deterministic", as its behavior cannot
 *       be predicted by the XQuery processor. You may annotate a function as
 *       {@link Deterministic} if you know that it will have no side-effects and will
 *       always yield the same result.</li>
 *   <li>Java code is treated as "context-independent". If a function accesses
 *       the specified {@link #context}, it should be annotated as
 *       {@link ContextDependent}.</li>
 *   <li>Java code is treated as "focus-independent". If a function accesses
 *       the current context item, position or size, it should be annotated as
 *       {@link FocusDependent}.</li>
 * </ul>
