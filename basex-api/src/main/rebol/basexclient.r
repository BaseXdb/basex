getmd5: func [ 
{
An Md5 function, the way it is done in other languages. For some reason
Rebol gives the MD5 in uppercase. This takes in a string and gives out
its md5 hash
}
s [string!] ] [  

lowercase replace/all 
	  replace/all mold checksum/method copy s 'md5 "#{" ""  
	  "}" ""

]

gethashed: func[
	
{
	Two params: 1st is the password, 2nd the time stamp
 	It concantenates the md5 hash of the password with the password
 	and then make an md5 hash of the entire concatenation
 	That is how BaseX likes it
}

execBaseX: func [ 
{
1st param: username 2nd: Password. 3rd: BaseX command 
Example of 3rd param: "XQUERY basex:db('test')//author"
Refinement /p specifies port
Refinement /w specifies timeout (not used in this version)
This does complete execution of one BaseX command right from login to logout
It has a refinement /p using which you can specify the port to which to write to

BaseXLogin:  func [ 
{
1st param: username 2nd: Password. Refinement /p specifies port
Refinement /w specifies timeout (not used in this version)
This returns a connection port that can be used later
After you finish using the connection, make sure you do close it by using BaseXLogout

This takes two arguments. 1st one is a connection port, 2nd is the BaseX command to be executed

{This has to be called to close the BaseX connection}

] [
insert c "EXIT^@" ;This is the logout function in BaseX. It closes the session
close c ;;; and also closes the port!
