======================================================== BASEX TESTS ===

 This package contains various tests that are used in BaseX development.
 These tests did not make it into the main repository because they are:

 * intended to be run for a long time
 * in the making
 * broken

 Tests can be run with maven:

 `mvn test`

 For questions or feedback, feel free to use the Tracker or our
