;A variable refenrencing itself e.g. "PATH=%PATH%;c:\java\test" will result in an import from the environment. 
;JSL will first look in the normal environment then in the system environment of the registry as a fallback.
;Any variable not in the defines section will result in a environment lookup as well.
;Variable substitution is possible in any value in the ini file

;Do not use the path parameter if you also set "PATH"in the export parameter as precedence is undefined.

;Allocate a console and register a console event handler to catch shutdown events.
;Default is true; options are FALSE TRUE false true YES NO yes no
;This option has two effects:
;1. If active it catches the logoff events and prevents the service from erroneously stopping in this case.
;2. It creates a console window if interaction with the desktop is allowd.
;Effect 1 can be achieved in Java 1.3.1 and higher by using the -Xrs option.
;Effect 2 may or may not be desired.

;Call <stopclass>.<stopmethod> through JNI so stop the JVM.
;This can be used an alternative to the ServiceStopper 
;When all three parameters are defined the JSL will try to use JNI to stop the service. 
;If not it will use a tcp/ip connection to the stopport.
;The simplest way to use this functionality is to use the Systen.exit() call as specified below. 
;Nevertheless you can call any static method in your code.   
;The method called is expected to terminate the JVM one way or the other. It can directly 
;call System.exit() or make another Thread do it make the main method return. 
;The method can return imediately if desired. If the JVM doesn't stop another attempt can be made to 
;stop the service at a later time.

;Take care to specify the right signature for your method. void System.exit( int code ) has

;Parameters can be passed in "stopparam".

;stderr=c:\stderr.log

;Redirect JAVA level System.out and System.err to the specified files
;This simply sets new output streams for System.out and System.err after
;the JVM is initialized but before the main method is called.
;You might find that this option has no effect at all for some applications, as the 
;JAVA application is of course free to redirect System.out and System.err

;Default is no redirection
;Default is to overwrite file

;This method will be called before the main method of the start class specified on command line 
;but after the JVM is fully initialized and stdout and stderr redirection have been performed.
;This method must return! It is called from the same thread as the main method.
;In order for the normal JVM start behaviour to continue this method must return 0.
;It may legally return any other value or throw any exception, which in both cases will result in
;a regular termination of the JVM much in the same way as if an uncatched exception had been thrown
;in the main method.
;It may legally start other threads in the JVM, which will behave in the same way as started from
;the main method.
;In fact you will be able to produce pretty much the same behaviour as calling the static method first in
;your main method.
;The example method present here is a scheduler which will in turn run the code specified 
;in its modules list. Some utilities are provided.

;Report service stopped on exit of main thread
;you might want to set this to yes if your service terminates "silently"
;It is recommended that a service is stopped by calling System.exit() at some time, 
;either externally or internally. This provides a nice and clean shutdown hook.
;If the service terminates silently by just ending the last thread this might result 
;in the service manager not recognizing the fact and denying restart. Use yes in this case.
;It should usually be safe to use reportservicestoppedonmainthreadexit=true
;even if you use other threads then main. The shutdown code will wait for non daemon threads to stop
